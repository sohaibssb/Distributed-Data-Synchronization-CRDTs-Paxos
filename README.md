# Distributed-Data-Synchronization-Using-Paxos-CRDTs
Develop Dynamic Method for data consistency in distributed systems using advantages of CRDTs and Paxos Algorithms

Programmed by Sohaibssb for Master degree research under subject "Methods of Syncretization Data in Distribution System" at Bauman University, Moscow. 2023/2024

------------------

About the Dynamic method:

This program presents and implements a method that combines the strengths of conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) and Paxos algorithms, offering a dynamic approach to data consistency in distributed systems.
